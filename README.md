# My online CV

You can find the hosted GitHub Pages version [here](https://justus.science/cv).

I forked this CV from [sharu725](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv). If you
want to use it too, you should go there. Also changes and improvements to the
base theme should be done there.

If you however know me better than myself and thus wish to correct data on the
CV itself I am more than happy to accept Issues and PR's.
