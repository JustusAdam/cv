career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    My main occupation since 2013 has been studying computer science at TU
    Dresden. During that time I was also active in the student repesentation
    of the faculty for about a year and a half. 
    
    Since 2015 I have also been working as a student research assistant at the
    Chair for Compiler Construction, developing a parallelizing compiler
    called [Ohua](https://ohua-dev.github.io).

education:
  - degree: MSc in Computer Science (not yet graduated)
    university: Technische Universität Dresden
    time: 2016 - Present
    details: |
      My advanced studies in CS mostly focused on distributed systems and
      parallel programming. 

      At the same time I have researched and written seminars on topics on
      functional programming, software transactional programming, free monads
      and extensible effects.

      My masters thesis will focus on deep integration of User Defined
      Functions in databases. You can find my slides for the introductory talk
      of the topic [here](https://justus.science/pdfs/forschungsprojekt.pdf).

  - degree: BSc in Computer Science
    university: Technische Universität Dresden
    time: 2013 - 2016
    details: |
      Undergraduate studies in Germany have a mostly fixed curriculum spanning
      the basics of computing machine implementation, logic, mathematics,
      graph theory, algorithmic thinking and complexity theory etc.

      The courses I was able to choose were Compiler Construction and Database
      Programming.

      A link to the thesis itself is in the [publications
      section](#publications). There is also a [git repo](https://github.com/JustusAdam/bt)

experiences:
  - role: Student Research Assistant
    time: 2015 - Present
    company: Chair for Compiler Construction - TU Dresden
    details: |
      I helped develop a parallelizing compiler called
      [Ohua](https://ohua-dev.github.io). I had significant input on all parts
      of the design of the compiler frontend and its lambda calculus based
      intermediate language. In addition I implemented a large part of the
      IR-passes performed in the compiler.

  - role: Student Tutor
    time: 2014 - 2015
    company: Informatikfakultät - TU Dresden
    details: |
      I tutored a few courses at the CS faculty. Those were computer science
      for mechanical engineering students, mostly using C#, also a
      introductory robotics programming lab class for frechmen CS students and
      I also offered a voluntary class for interemediate level Python and one
      for Haskell in two subsequent terms.

  - role: Work and Travel
    time: 2012 - 2013
    company: Mostly KFC and Taco Bell Canada
    details: |
      I spent a little over 10 months in Kelowna, Canada on a Work and Travel
      program to take a peek and the country and culture.

      During this time I did pretty much any job our small fast restarant requred.
