career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    In the beginning of 2020 I finished my Masters Degree from the Technische
    Universität Dresden and I am now in the pursuit of a PhD at the University
    of Kent in Canterbury.

    During my Undergraduate I worked as a student research assistant at the
    Chair for Compiler Construction, developing a parallelizing compiler
    called [Ohua](https://ohua-dev.github.io). And I was also active as a member
    of the student representation, i.e. the union.

education:
  - degree: PhD in Computer Science (in progress)
    university: University of Kent, Canterbury
    time: 2020 - Present
    details: |
      I am trying to bring advanced analyses enabled by modern, strong type
      systems to older languages with less expressive type systems, such as C
      and Java.

      For a more detailed description see my [Kent Staff
      Page](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/rpg/ja679/)
  - degree: M. Sc. in Computer Science
    university: Technische Universität Dresden
    time: 2016 - 2020
    details: |
      My advanced studies in CS mostly focused on distributed systems and
      parallel programming.

      At the same time I have researched and written assignments on functional
      programming, [software transactional
      memory](https://github.com/JustusAdam/stm-summary-paper), [free monads and
      extensible effects](https://github.com/JustusAdam/free-monad-evolution).

      My masters thesis focuses on deep integration of User Defined Functions in
      databases. You can find my slides for the introductory talk of the topic
      [here](https://justus.science/pdfs/forschungsprojekt.pdf).

  - degree: B. Sc. in Computer Science
    university: Technische Universität Dresden
    time: 2013 - 2016
    details: |
      Undergraduate studies in Germany have a mostly fixed curriculum spanning
      the basics of computing machine implementation, logic, mathematics,
      graph theory, algorithmic thinking and complexity theory etc.

      For the advanced courses I chose Compiler Construction and Database
      Programming.

      A link to the thesis itself is in the [publications
      section](#publications). There is also a [git repo](https://github.com/JustusAdam/bt)

experiences:
  - role: Student Research Assistant
    time: 2015 - 2020
    company: Chair for Compiler Construction - TU Dresden
    details: |
      I helped develop a parallelizing compiler called
      [Ohua](https://ohua-dev.github.io) under the supervision of [Sebastian
      Ertel](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/sebastian-ertel). I worked on the
      semantics of the language, the compiler frontend, its lambda calculus
      based intermediate language and the transformation passes.

  - role: Student Tutor
    time: 2014 - 2015
    company: Faculty for Computer Science - TU Dresden
    details: |
      I tutored computer science for mechanical engineering students, mostly
      using C# and a introductory robotics programming lab class for freshmen CS
      students.

      I also offered a voluntary class for intermediate level Python and one
      for Haskell in two subsequent terms.

  - role: Work and Travel
    time: 2012 - 2013
    company: Mostly KFC and Taco Bell Canada
    details: |
      I spent a little over 10 months in Kelowna, Canada on a Work and Travel
      program to take a peek and the country and culture.

      During this time I did pretty much any job our small fast food restaurant required.
